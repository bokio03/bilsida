                            <p>The BMW M5, a flagship model within the BMW 5 Series, proudly carries the prestigious BMW M sub-brand. Revered as an iconic representation in the sports sedan category, the M5 has primarily been manufactured in the sedan (saloon) body style. However, it's interesting to note that, in select regions, this exceptional vehicle has also been made available as an estate (wagon) model during specific time periods. This diverse range of body styles underlines the M5's adaptability to varied market demands.
